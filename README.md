# Reactest
A simple react page to dynamically display static information.



# Requirement analysis
Need a nice way to display aggregate information about Numenera character options.

* As a newbie player, I want to easily see my options on a single page, so that I can create a character without reading half a book.

* As an experienced player, I want to quickly search and access all available options from a single place, so that I can easily see interesting combinations.

* As a GM, I want to quickly compare all options and tiers, so that I can get an overall idea of the game balance and add notes if necessary and so that I can easily manage new options.

* As a huge nerd, I want to dive in nerd intersecitonality, so I can learn new stuff and keep my brain working on a wide variety of things.
